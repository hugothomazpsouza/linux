# Steps to generate SSH keys:

1 - Generate an RSA Key:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_catalyst
```

-t rsa: Specifies RSA as the key type.
-b 2048: Indicates the size of the key (2048 bits is recommended).
-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_catalyst: Specifies the file where the key will be saved.
Follow the on-screen instructions to set a passphrase (optional).

2 - Generate an ED25519 Key: From Cisco IOS XE 17.10.1a onwards, the Catalyst 8000V supports ED25519 keys, which are more efficient than RSA. Use this command:
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_catalyst
```

-t ed25519: Specifies ED25519 as the key type.
-f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_catalyst: Specifies the file where the key will be saved.

Again, set a passphrase if needed.

3 - Copy the Public Key to the Catalyst 8000V Instance: Once the keys are generated, copy the public key to your Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance.
```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_catalyst.pub <username>@<catalyst-instance-ip>
```
or
```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_catalyst.pub <username>@<catalyst-instance-ip>
```


4 - Verify Key-Based SSH Access: Now, try to SSH into your Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance using the private key:

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_catalyst <username>@<catalyst-instance-ip>
```
or
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_catalyst <username>@<catalyst-instance-ip>
```
If the setup is successful, you will be logged in without needing a password.
