Generation of a Self Signed Certificate

Generation of a self-signed SSL certificate involves a simple 3-step procedure:

STEP 1: Create the server private key

openssl genrsa -out cert.key 2048
STEP 2: Create the certificate signing request (CSR)

openssl req -new -key cert.key -out cert.csr
STEP 3: Sign the certificate using the private key and CSR

openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in cert.csr -signkey cert.key -out cert.crt
Congratulations! You now have a self-signed SSL certificate valid for 10 years.
